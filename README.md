# ConvexHull-Visualization
A java based Teaching tool  that can used to visualize how the convex hull of a set of points change when one adds points.

# This is a simple Java based tool to visualize how the conex hull of set of points in the 2 dimensional plane changes as one adds points to the set.
Things to note:

# The sizing of the frame was optimised for my purposes. One can adjust it by changing the WIDTH and HEIGHT parameters in the MouseEvents class.
# I would usually draw 3 points and draw the convex hull by hitting the "draw convex hull button". Then I would add points, and the convex hull will be redrawn automatically
# The code for generating the convex Hull itself is based on the the code available here : https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Convex_hull#Java
