# ConvexHull-Visualization


This is a simple Java based tool to visualize how the conex hull of set of points 2 dimensional plane changes as one adds points to the set.
Things to note:
- To launch the GUI, run the main method of the MouseEvents class

- The sizing of the frame was optimised for my purposes. One can adjust it by changing the WIDTH and HEIGHT parameters in the MouseEvents class.
- I would usually draw 3 points and draw the convex hull by hitting the "draw convex hull button". Then I would add points, and the convex hull will be redrawn automatically
- The code for generating the convex Hull itself is based on the the code available here : https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Convex_hull#Java
